description: A comedy of manners by William Congreve, was performed and published
  in 1700.  The play, considered to be Congreve's masterpiece, ridicules assumptions
  that governed the society of his time, especially those concerning love and marriage.   The
  plot centers around the efforts of lovers Millamant and Mirabell to obtain the permission
  of Millamant's aunt for their marriage.  Despite a scheme that goes awry and after
  several misunderstandings are cleared up, the two finally obtain her consent.
